# model_solar_panel
Developing a Linear regression model for forecasting solar panel intensity using local weather data.

Parameters for weather data include:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Hours

Output:
* Predicted solar power generated (MW)
* Deviation from observed solar panel measurements

Presumptions based on Weather Underground data:
* Humidity represents relative humidity in percentage
* Temperature is taken as average temperature in Fahrenheit
